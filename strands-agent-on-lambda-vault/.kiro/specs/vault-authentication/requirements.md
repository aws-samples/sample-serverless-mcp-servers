# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to reconfigure the Gradio UI authentication system to use HashiCorp Vault URL for username/password authentication instead of the current AWS Cognito implementation. The change will allow users to authenticate using Vault's OIDC provider while maintaining the existing user experience and security standards.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to authenticate to the Travel Agent application using my Vault credentials, so that I can access the application without needing separate Cognito credentials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the application THEN the system SHALL redirect unauthenticated users to a Vault-based login page.
2. WHEN a user enters valid Vault credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate the user and redirect them to the chat interface.
3. WHEN a user's authentication token expires THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to re-authenticate.
4. WHEN a user clicks the logout button THEN the system SHALL clear their session and redirect them to the login page.

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate with Vault's OIDC provider, so that I can leverage Vault's authentication capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the application THEN the system SHALL use environment variables for Vault OIDC configuration.
2. WHEN initializing the application THEN the system SHALL establish a connection with the Vault OIDC provider.
3. WHEN receiving authentication callbacks THEN the system SHALL properly validate tokens with the Vault OIDC provider.
4. WHEN handling user sessions THEN the system SHALL securely store and manage Vault-issued tokens.

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the authentication transition to be seamless, so that users experience minimal disruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the new authentication system THEN the system SHALL maintain the same user interface flow.
2. WHEN users authenticate THEN the system SHALL extract the same user information fields as before.
3. WHEN communicating with backend services THEN the system SHALL pass authentication tokens in the same format as before.
4. WHEN handling errors during authentication THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages to users.

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security officer, I want to ensure the new authentication method maintains security standards, so that user data remains protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing authentication tokens THEN the system SHALL use secure session storage.
2. WHEN implementing authentication flows THEN the system SHALL follow OIDC best practices.
3. WHEN handling authentication failures THEN the system SHALL not expose sensitive information.
4. WHEN a session is terminated THEN the system SHALL properly invalidate all tokens.
